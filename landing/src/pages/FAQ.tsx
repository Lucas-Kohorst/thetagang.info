            <p>
              Theta Vault is a new product that automates a covered call
              strategy to earn high yield on ETH. The vault runs a covered call
              strategy and sells out of the money call options on a weekly basis
              for yield. You can read more about the strategy{" "}

        question: "What Options Protocol does the Theta Vault use?",
        answer:
          "Theta Vault currently uses Opyn's infrastructure to mint and trade the options tokens on-chain. We chose Opyn because the protocol lets us create tokenized ETH options with custom parameters out of the box. This allows us to be flexible on the choice of strikes, expiries, and exchange method.

            <p>
              The yield is variable, but we expect it to be in the 20-30% range.
              We performed a backtest on the strategy throughout 2020 and 2021,
              and you can see the results{" "}

            <p>
              The yield in production will likely be lower due to transaction
              costs and so on, but we can expect something in the double-digit
              APY range.

        question: "What are the risks of the Theta Vault?",
        answer: (
          <span>
            <p>
              The primary risk for running this strategy is that depositors
              could potentially give up upside in exchange for guaranteed yield.
              By selling a call option, users are basically promising to sell
              the asset at the strike price, even if it goes above it (a.k.a
              selling early). Because of this, if the price of the asset moves
              up significantly in a short period of time, it is possible for
              depositors to have "negative yield" on their ETH.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, this only happens if ETH/USD appreciates significantly,
              so depositors will still be up in USD terms. The vault also sells
              call options that are very out of the money, which means there is
              a relatively low chance of the options getting exercised.

        question:
          "Why do I need to give Theta Vaults approval to spend my assets?",
        answer: (
          <span>
            <p>
              On the Ethereum blockchain, wallets have full control over their
              ERC20 tokens. In order to let an application spend a wallet's
              tokens, the user has to explicitly give permission to the
              application to spend them. This is what's called an ERC20
              allowance. Theta Vaults prompt users to approve an unlimited
              amount so that users do not have to re-approve the application on
              a subsequent deposit.
